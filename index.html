            <p>
                I am currently a student at the UCI coding bootcamp. I graduated from UCSB with an economics and math undergraduate degree and have been working at US Bank for 5 years. I want to explore careers in coding and software developing. In my free time, I like to travel, explore different cuisines and play vide games.
